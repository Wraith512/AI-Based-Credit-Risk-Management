# AI-Based-Credit-Risk-Management
This project develops an AI-based credit risk system that predicts loan default risk and classifies applicants into low, medium, or high-risk categories using machine learning.

This project focuses on building an AI-driven system to assess credit risk and predict loan default using machine learning. Historical applicant data such as income, credit history, and spending patterns is used to train and test different classification models. These models are compared to find the most accurate approach for predicting risk. The system then generates a risk score and classifies applicants into different risk levels. This helps financial institutions make consistent and data-driven loan approval decisions.
